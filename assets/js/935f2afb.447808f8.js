This CAT standard allows you to create fungible tokens on the Chia blockchain. This step-by-step guide will go through creating your own CATs.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-concepts/chialisp-concepts-condition-morphing":{"id":"chialisp-concepts/chialisp-concepts-condition-morphing","title":"Condition Morphing","description":"You\'ve seen how you can use inner puzzles to output conditions and append them to the output of the outer puzzle. However, sometimes you want to change the output of the inner puzzle to enforce certain rules. This is called condition morphing.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-concepts/chialisp-concepts-currying":{"id":"chialisp-concepts/chialisp-concepts-currying","title":"Currying","description":"When you are writing puzzles in Chialisp you may want to have certain parameters decided before the coins are created. This is called currying. It allows puzzles to be reused but have different content and produce a different hash.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-concepts/chialisp-concepts-inner-puzzles":{"id":"chialisp-concepts/chialisp-concepts-inner-puzzles","title":"Inner Puzzles","description":"Sometimes you want the behavior of your puzzles to be composable, so that you can reuse code in multiple ways. An example of this is the Chia Asset Token puzzle, which allows you to specify an inner puzzle.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-bls-signatures":{"id":"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-bls-signatures","title":"5. BLS Signatures","description":"When creating a spend bundle previously, we have left the aggregated_signature field set to the default value of c0 followed by 190 zeros. This value indicates that there are no signatures. We will detail what signatures are, and how you can use them on the blockchain.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-first-smart-coin":{"id":"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-first-smart-coin","title":"4. First Smart Coin","description":"By now, you should understand what Chialisp is and how you can use it to write programs and modules that can be run on the command-line. In this guide, we are going to write a simple puzzle, use it to lock a coin with a password, and finally spend it. This example is insecure for a variety of reasons which will be explained after, but it\'s a good tool for learning how smart coins work.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-intro":{"id":"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-intro","title":"1. Intro to Chialisp","description":"Chialisp is a language based on Lisp that is used on the Chia blockchain to dictate how and when coins can be spent. It\'s designed to be as simple and efficient as possible, but still provide broad functionality and Turing Completeness.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-testnet-setup":{"id":"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-testnet-setup","title":"3.

Using Modules","description":"Up to this point, you have written single expressions and evaluated them on the command-line. However, sometimes you want to split your code into multiple functions or include common libraries. In order to do things like that, you will need to understand what modules are.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"crash-course/cats-offers-nfts":{"id":"crash-course/cats-offers-nfts","title":"CATs, Offers and NFTs","description":"For this lesson you will want Chia installed and synced on testnet."},"crash-course/chialisp":{"id":"crash-course/chialisp","title":"Chialisp","description":"For this section of the course, you will learn how to set up your development environment, write Chialisp code, and execute it on the command-line."},"crash-course/chialisp-and-typescript":{"id":"crash-course/chialisp-and-typescript","title":"Chialisp and TypeScript","description":"So far we\'ve been working with the Chia blockchain directly through the terminal using Chia Dev Tools the Chia command line interface."},"crash-course/inner-puzzles":{"id":"crash-course/inner-puzzles","title":"Inner Puzzles","description":"Puzzles all have something in common, they output a list of conditions.

We\'ll start off with a foundational understanding of the Chia blockchain. This includes what blockchains are for and what makes Chia different from other options. Once you understand the basics, we\'ll learn about plotting and farming. Finally, we\'ll cover many of the DeFi possibilities including fungible tokens (CATs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and writing custom coins in Chialisp."},"crash-course/notes":{"id":"crash-course/notes","title":"notes","description":"You can get information on your plotNFT:"},"crash-course/signatures":{"id":"crash-course/signatures","title":"Signatures","description":"In the previous lesson we created our first coin and spent it. This was fun and a good exercise, but had some security problems. Specifically, we used a hashed password. This is very limited because once you spend that coin, your provided solution is revealed and your password can no longer be used securely for anything in the future."},"crash-course/smart-coins":{"id":"crash-course/smart-coins","title":"Smart Coins","description":"Everything on the Chia blockchain is a coin. They are often referred to as smart coins because every coin has a Chialisp program associated with it. That program, known as a puzzle, decides how and when the coin can be spent, and what happens when it is. NFTs, CATs, and standard transactions are all defined using puzzles. Another example of something you can do with Chialisp is lock up funds until a certain amount of time has elapsed."},"crash-course/state":{"id":"crash-course/state","title":"State","description":"Coin Set Refresher"},"custody/custody-tool-description":{"id":"custody/custody-tool-description","title":"Custody Tool Description","description":"The majority of Chia Network Inc\'s prefarm is being held in a cold wallet, secured by a complex set of custodial rules.
