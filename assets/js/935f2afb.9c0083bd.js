However, sometimes you want to change the output of the inner puzzle to enforce certain rules. This is called condition morphing.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-concepts/chialisp-concepts-currying":{"id":"chialisp-concepts/chialisp-concepts-currying","title":"Currying","description":"When you are writing puzzles in Chialisp you may want to have certain parameters decided before the coins are created. This is called currying. It allows puzzles to be reused but have different content and produce a different hash.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-concepts/chialisp-concepts-inner-puzzles":{"id":"chialisp-concepts/chialisp-concepts-inner-puzzles","title":"Inner Puzzles","description":"Sometimes you want the behavior of your puzzles to be composable, so that you can reuse code in multiple ways. An example of this is the Chia Asset Token puzzle, which allows you to specify an inner puzzle.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-bls-signatures":{"id":"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-bls-signatures","title":"5. BLS Signatures","description":"When creating a spend bundle previously, we have left the aggregated_signature field set to the default value of c0 followed by 190 zeros. This value indicates that there are no signatures. We will detail what signatures are, and how you can use them on the blockchain.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-first-smart-coin":{"id":"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-first-smart-coin","title":"4. First Smart Coin","description":"By now, you should understand what Chialisp is and how you can use it to write programs and modules that can be run on the command-line. In this guide, we are going to write a simple puzzle, use it to lock a coin with a password, and finally spend it. This example is insecure for a variety of reasons which will be explained after, but it\'s a good tool for learning how smart coins work.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-intro":{"id":"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-intro","title":"1. Intro to Chialisp","description":"Chialisp is a language based on Lisp that is used on the Chia blockchain to dictate how and when coins can be spent. It\'s designed to be as simple and efficient as possible, but still provide broad functionality and Turing Completeness.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-testnet-setup":{"id":"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-testnet-setup","title":"3.

Using Modules","description":"Up to this point, you have written single expressions and evaluated them on the command-line. However, sometimes you want to split your code into multiple functions or include common libraries. In order to do things like that, you will need to understand what modules are.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"crash-course/cats-offers-nfts":{"id":"crash-course/cats-offers-nfts","title":"CATs, Offers and NFTs","description":"For this lesson you will want Chia installed and synced on testnet."},"crash-course/intro-to-chialisp":{"id":"crash-course/intro-to-chialisp","title":"Chialisp","description":"To get started with Chialisp you will first want to install the Chia Dev Tools. You can refer to the Chia Dev Tools repository for more information, but the summary of the installation is here:"},"crash-course/introduction":{"id":"crash-course/introduction","title":"Introduction","description":"This course is designed to give you an end-to-end introduction to Chia. We\'ll start off with a foundational understanding of the Chia blockchain. This includes what blockchains are for and what makes Chia different from other options. Once you understand the basics, we\'ll learn about plotting and farming. Finally, we\'ll cover many of the DeFi possibilities including fungible tokens (CATs), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), and writing custom coins in Chialisp."},"crash-course/notes":{"id":"crash-course/notes","title":"notes","description":"You can get information on your plotNFT:"},"datalayer/datalayer-user-guide":{"id":"datalayer/datalayer-user-guide","title":"DataLayer User Guide","description":"This document will guide you through the process of setting up Chia\'s DataLayer and running a few basic functions.

It will demonstrate this functionality using both the command-line and RPCs on Windows, MacOS and Linux. It will also show you how to verify that your NFTs are working as designed in Chia\'s Electron wallet. We\'ll use the testnet for most of this guide, but we\'ll also give you some tips on deploying NFTs on Chia\'s mainnet.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"nft/nft-rpc":{"id":"nft/nft-rpc","title":"Minting NFTs With RPC","description":"The next section of this tutorial will demonstrate how to create and use DIDs and NFTs using RPCs.
