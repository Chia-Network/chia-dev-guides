This value indicates that there are no signatures. We will detail what signatures are, and how you can use them on the blockchain.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-first-smart-coin":{"id":"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-first-smart-coin","title":"First Smart Coin","description":"By now, you should understand what Chialisp is and how you can use it to write programs and modules that can be run on the command-line. In this guide, we are going to write a simple puzzle, use it to lock a coin with a password, and finally spend it. This example is insecure for a variety of reasons which will be explained after, but it\'s a good tool for learning how smart coins work.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-intro":{"id":"chialisp-primer/chialisp-primer-intro","title":"Intro to Chialisp","description":"Chialisp is a language based on Lisp that is used on the Chia blockchain to dictate how and when coins can be spent.

In order to do things like that, you will need to understand what modules are.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"nft/nft-cli":{"id":"nft/nft-cli","title":"Minting NFTs With CLI","description":"The next section of this tutorial will demonstrate how to create and use DIDs and NFTs on the CLI.

It will demonstrate this functionality using both the command-line and RPCs on Windows, MacOS and Linux. It will also show you how to verify that your NFTs are working as designed in Chia\'s Electron wallet. We\'ll use the testnet for most of this guide, but we\'ll also give you some tips on deploying NFTs on Chia\'s mainnet.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"nft/nft-rpc":{"id":"nft/nft-rpc","title":"Minting NFTs With RPC","description":"The next section of this tutorial will demonstrate how to create and use DIDs and NFTs using RPCs.
